## Professional Statement

I am a results-driven professional transitioning into cybersecurity after more than a decade in high-performance sales leadership within the mortgage industry and earlier experience as a cable technician. I am pursuing a career in cybersecurity to build long-term stability while continuing to thrive in fast-paced, problem-solving environments.

I am motivated by complex challenges and enjoy breaking down difficult technical problems into actionable solutions. My background in managing teams, working under pressure, and resolving real-world issues has prepared me to excel in a Security Operations Center (SOC) role where attention to detail, analytical thinking, and adaptability are critical.

My goal is to secure an entry-level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst position and grow into advanced cybersecurity and cloud security roles through hands-on experience and continuous professional development.
