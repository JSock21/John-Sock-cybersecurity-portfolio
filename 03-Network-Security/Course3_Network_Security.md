# Course 3 – Network Security

This document summarizes my learning from Course 3 of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focused on network architecture, data communication, and foundational network security concepts.

---

## Types of Networks
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Wireless networks
- Cloud-based networks
- Understanding network types helps determine attack surface and security requirements

---

## Physical Components of a Network
- Routers
- Switches
- Firewalls
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Physical components control how data flows and how access is enforced

---

## TCP/IP Model
- The TCP/IP model provides a framework for how data is transmitted across networks
- Understanding layers helps SOC analysts troubleshoot and identify where attacks occur
- Layered communication supports structured monitoring and analysis

---

## Data Transmission Over Networks
- Data is broken into packets before transmission
- Packets are routed based on addressing and network rules
- Security tools inspect traffic during transmission to detect threats

---

## Network Architecture
- Network architecture defines how devices and systems are organized
- Common architectures include client-server and cloud-based models
- Architecture impacts visibility, security controls, and incident response

---

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
Understanding networks allows SOC analysts to interpret alerts, analyze network traffic, identify suspicious communication patterns, and respond effectively to network-based threats.
