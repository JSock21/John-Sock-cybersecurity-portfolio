# Course 3 – Network Security

This document summarizes my learning from Course 3 of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, with a focus on network architecture, data communication, and foundational network security concepts.

## Types of Networks
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**  
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**  
- **Wireless networks**  
- **Cloud-based networks**  

Understanding different network types helps determine attack surface, exposure, and appropriate security controls.

## Physical Components of a Network
- Routers  
- Switches  
- Firewalls  
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)  

Physical network components control how data flows through a network and how access is enforced and monitored.

---

## TCP/IP Model
- The TCP/IP model provides a structured framework for how data is transmitted across networks
- Understanding protocol layers helps SOC analysts identify where communication failures or attacks occur
- Layered communication supports efficient troubleshooting, monitoring, and incident investigation

---

## Data Transmission Over Networks
- Data is broken into packets before being transmitted
- Packets are routed based on addressing information and network rules
- Security tools inspect network traffic during transmission to detect anomalies and potential threats

---

## Network Architecture
- Network architecture defines how systems and devices are organized and communicate
- Common architectures include client-server and cloud-based models
- Architecture decisions directly impact visibility, security control placement, and incident response effectiveness

---

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
Understanding network fundamentals allows SOC analysts to interpret alerts, analyze network traffic, identify suspicious communication patterns, and respond effectively to network-based threats.
