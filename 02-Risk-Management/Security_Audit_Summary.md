# Security Controls & Compliance Assessment

This document summarizes a security audit activity completed as part of Course 2 of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. The activity involved evaluating existing security controls and identifying compliance gaps related to PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC principles.

## Objective
To assess an organization's security posture by reviewing administrative, technical, and physical controls, and to identify risks related to non-compliance with industry standards.

## Control Areas Reviewed
- Administrative controls (least privilege, password policies, separation of duties)
- Technical controls (firewalls, IDS, antivirus, encryption, backups)
- Physical controls (locks, CCTV, fire detection systems)

## Compliance Areas Reviewed
- PCI DSS (credit card data protection)
- GDPR (data privacy and breach notification requirements)
- SOC 1 / SOC 2 principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability)

## Key Findings
- Identified missing or incomplete security controls that increase organizational risk
- Noted gaps in encryption and password management practices
- Recognized compliance shortcomings related to data protection and access controls

## Recommendations
- Implement stronger access control and least-privilege policies
- Enhance encryption and password management systems
- Improve monitoring and incident response readiness
- Align controls more closely with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC requirements

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
Understanding security controls and compliance requirements allows SOC analysts to better assess alerts, recognize control failures, and prioritize incidents based on organizational risk and regulatory impact.
