# Course 2 – Risk Management

This document summarizes my learning from Course 2 of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focused on managing security risks through security domains, frameworks, controls, tools, and incident response playbooks.

---

## Security Domains
- Security domains represent distinct areas of responsibility within cybersecurity
- Domains help organize security efforts such as governance, risk management, incident response, and access control
- Understanding security domains ensures security responsibilities are clearly defined and managed across an organization

---

## Security Frameworks and Controls

### Security Frameworks
- Security frameworks provide standardized guidance for managing security risks
- Frameworks help organizations align security practices with business objectives and compliance requirements
- Using frameworks promotes consistency in risk assessment, control implementation, and incident handling

### Security Controls
- **Administrative controls** define policies, procedures, and guidelines that manage security risk
- **Technical controls** use technology to protect systems and data, such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls
- **Physical controls** protect facilities and hardware from unauthorized access

## Risk Management Process
- Identify risks by reviewing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Assess risks based on likelihood and potential impact
- Prioritize risks to focus on the most critical threats
- Mitigate risks by implementing appropriate security controls
- Continuously monitor and reassess risks as systems and threats evolve

---

## Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools
- Cybersecurity tools support the detection, prevention, and response to security threats
- Common tool categories include monitoring tools, access control tools, and incident response tools
- Tools help security teams collect data, generate alerts, and support investigation activities
- Effective use of tools requires understanding their purpose, limitations, and appropriate application

---

## Incident Response Playbooks
- Playbooks provide structured, repeatable steps for responding to specific types of security incidents
- Playbooks help ensure consistent and efficient incident handling across security teams
- Common playbook activities include detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery
- Using playbooks reduces response time and supports accurate documentation and escalation

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
Understanding security domains, frameworks, controls, tools, and playbooks enables SOC analysts to assess alerts within a risk-based context, identify control gaps, and respond to incidents consistently. Risk management principles help prioritize alerts, guide escalation decisions, and align incident response with organizational security objectives.
