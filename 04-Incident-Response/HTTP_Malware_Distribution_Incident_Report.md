# HTTP Malware Distribution Incident Report – Web Server Compromise

This document summarizes a security incident analysis involving malicious file distribution through a compromised website. The analysis focused on network traffic inspection, protocol identification, and attacker behavior.

---

## Incident Summary
Customers reported that when visiting a legitimate recipe website, they were prompted to download and execute a file claiming to provide access to additional content. After execution, users experienced system slowdowns and suspicious behavior. The website owner was also locked out of the administrator account.

---

## Network Protocol Involved
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- The malicious file was delivered to users over HTTP at the application layer
- Network traffic analysis confirmed HTTP requests associated with file download and redirection

---

## Detection
- Multiple user reports of suspicious download prompts
- Website administrator account lockout
- Suspicious redirects observed after file execution
- Network traffic captured and reviewed using packet analysis tools

---

## Investigation and Analysis
- A sandbox environment was used to safely interact with the website
- Network traffic was captured while accessing the site and executing the downloaded file
- Logs showed initial HTTP communication with the legitimate website
- After file execution, traffic shifted to a second external domain
- Analysis of the website source code revealed malicious JavaScript prompting file downloads
- The attacker likely gained access through a brute force attack on the administrator account and modified site content

---

## Impact
- End-user systems were compromised by executing a malicious file
- Users were redirected to a malicious external website
- Website integrity and user trust were affected
- Administrative access to the web server was compromised

---

## Identified Attack Techniques
- Brute force attack against administrator credentials
- Malicious file distribution over HTTP
- Client-side compromise via social engineering
- Unauthorized modification of website content

---

## Recommended Remediation
- Enforce strong, non-default administrative passwords
- Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute force attacks
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access
- Monitor web server logs and network traffic for unauthorized changes
- Validate and restrict file execution from untrusted sources

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
This incident demonstrates how SOC analysts correlate user reports with network traffic, identify protocol-based attacks, analyze attacker techniques, and recommend controls to prevent credential abuse and malware distribution.
