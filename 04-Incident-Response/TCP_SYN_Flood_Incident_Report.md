# TCP SYN Flood Incident Report – Network Denial of Service

This document summarizes an incident analysis involving abnormal TCP traffic that resulted in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The analysis was performed using network traffic logs similar to those generated by tools such as Wireshark.

---

## Incident Summary
Users experienced connection timeouts and were unable to access a company website. Network traffic analysis revealed a large volume of incomplete TCP connection attempts consistent with a SYN flood attack.

---

## Detection
- Website visitors reported connection timeouts
- Network logs showed an unusually high number of SYN packets
- TCP connections were not completing the three-way handshake

---

## Investigation and Analysis
- TCP three-way handshake behavior was reviewed (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)
- Logs showed repeated SYN requests from a single external IP address
- The attacker failed to complete the handshake, leaving connections half-open
- Legitimate user traffic began receiving reset (RST/ACK) packets and timeout errors
- HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors were observed as the server became overwhelmed

---

## Impact
- Web server resources were exhausted
- Legitimate users were unable to establish or maintain connections
- Website availability was disrupted

---

## Identified Attack Type
- Direct Denial of Service (DoS) attack
- TCP SYN flood targeting the web server

---

## Response and Escalation
- Incident details were documented clearly
- Findings were escalated to senior security and network teams
- Mitigation actions such as traffic filtering, rate limiting, or SYN flood protection were recommended

---

## How This Applies to a SOC Role
This incident demonstrates how SOC analysts analyze network traffic, identify abnormal TCP behavior, recognize denial-of-service attacks, assess business impact, and escalate incidents for mitigation and response.
